Autism is a behavioral disorder, usually seen in early childhood. It is common for autism to exhibit non-social behaviors. What autism means to me is the at autistic individuals often have problems communicating with other people since I have a boy with autism. Problems in communicating with their peers and their tendency to play games with their peers are typical of the illness.</p>

<p>Autistic individuals avoid avoiding eye contact. They do not play properly with their toys. There is an extreme concern for the returning objects. They exhibit continuous and repetitive behaviors. Autistic children who have reached the age of 2 also have the ability to avoid meaningful sentences of one or two words. Individuals with autism signs should be taken to a doctor’s office.</p>

<p>What is meant by autism, questions like how normal life affects can be asked. The social circles and educational lives are also affected because autistic individuals have problems completing their developmental stages. For this reason, it is imperative that the autistic individuals are given special education and are supported by auxiliary aids.</p>
