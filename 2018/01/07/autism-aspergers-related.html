    <p>Asperger syndrome and autism are often confused. There are some similarities that will cause this, but in fact there are many distinct differences that distinguish Asperger children from autistic children.</p>

<h1 id="are-autism-and-aspergers-related-the-definitions">Are Autism and Aspergers related? The definitions</h1>
<p># 
Autism is a disease that occurs on the brain and affects one’s entire life throughout life. As we explained more detailed in one of our previous blog posts, <a href="https://autismeducation.me/autism-meaning-autism-education/">autism</a> is a highly complex neurodevelopmental spectrum disorder.</p>

<p>Asperger syndrome is a problem that starts in childhood and makes social interaction difficult. The most important symptoms are being excessively introverted, having communication problems and lack of skills. Its general characteristics are similar to autism. Just like autism, asperger syndrome is a condition whose cause is not known precisely and it affects patients in their lifetime.</p>

<h2 id="similarities-between-autism-and-aspergers">Similarities between Autism and Aspergers</h2>
<p>## 
The child’s inability to develop relationships with his / her peers in <a href="https://otsimo.com/en/asperger-syndrome-symptoms-diagnosis/">autism and aspergers</a> and emotional response is one of the main problems in both Asperger’s syndrome and Autism.
Again, there is a difficulty in playing games in both disorders, lack of imagination, and problems in communicating around the periphery.</p>

<p>Children who are involved in both groups can not express themselves correctly in nonverbal communication. Several behaviors such as facial expression, hand-arm movements, eyebrows, etc. appear to be distorted.</p>

<h3 id="differences-between-autism-and-aspergers">Differences between Autism and Aspergers</h3>
<p>### 
The main difference that distinguishes aspergillic children from autistic children is socialization.</p>

<p>Asperger children struggle to be social unlike autistic children. The most distinctive feature of autistic children is their lack of interest in living in their own world, returning to inside and outside world.</p>

<p>Asperger boys like to communicate with people. They may show love from early infancy.</p>

<p>The fact that children with Asperger’s syndrome do not have too much delay in language development is another feature that allows them to be separated from autistic children.</p>
