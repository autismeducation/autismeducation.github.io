There are different opinions about whether otitis is a definitive treatment. For example, it is said that some cases have achieved a hundred percent success, but such examples are considered limited. In addition, it is known that behavioral disorders can be eliminated at a great rate in the treatment of autistic individuals.</p>

<p>Can autism be completely cured is an important question. Specific methods for treatment of autism include: psychiatric autism treatment, gluten-casein treatment, heavy metal removal, neuro-feedback.</p>

<p>Since autism is a neurological disease, psychiatric treatment methods can be applied at first stage. Behavioral disorders of patients can be relieved by psychiatric treatment methods because the behavioral disturbances of autistic individuals trigger the progress of the disease.</p>

<p>Another method used for the question of can autism be completely cured in autistic treatment is gluten casein treatment. The main reason for this treatment method is that it is seen as gluten and casein as the cause of autism. The treatment of the disease focuses on the treatment of these two diseases.</p>
