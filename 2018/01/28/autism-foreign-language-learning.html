    <p>It is useful to have knowledge of who is practicing autism foreign language learning therapy before responding to the question of how language therapy is done. Autism foreign language learning is a method of treatment for the development of children with speech disorders or stuttering in general.</p>

<h1 id="autism-foreign-language-learning-techniques">Autism Foreign Language Learning Techniques</h1>
<p># 
There are certain methods for the implementation of autism foreign language learning therapy. Which of these methods can be used is entirely related to the patient’s condition. Which method is best for the patient’s problem is always used. The methods used for performing language therapy are as follows;</p>

<p>The first of these methods is the operation of speech organs. You can evaluate these methods as exercise. There are some major reflexes in the operation of speech organs. More work is being done to improve them.</p>

<p>## 
The second is language studies. It is important that the language move within language studies. The tongue is pulled in, pulled out or asked to perform certain movements with the tongue. These include autism foreign language learning studies.</p>

<p>The third method used is lip movements. The things that are required to be performed within the lip movements are simple. In general speaking, we need our lips to be able to make “b, f, ğ, m, p, v” sounds. Naturally, it is extremely important that lips work also among the techniques used in speech disorders.</p>

<p>### 
Following the studies on language, lips and speech organs, basic exercises in autism foreign language learning therapy are given. To give an example of what the basic exercises are, we can say to remove it from the tooth and the lip, to pull it back, to move it right and left in the mouth, and to lift the back of the tongue.</p>

<p>After the basic exercises are finished, the last topic that we can give an example of how to do autism foreign language learning therapy is the oral closing exercises. This is also important for speech therapy. A frequently observed issue in children with speech impairment is the constant openness of the mouth, the outflow of saliva, and the inability to master language. In order to prevent these situations, it is very important to complete the autism foreign language learning therapy by doing the mouth closing exercises.
