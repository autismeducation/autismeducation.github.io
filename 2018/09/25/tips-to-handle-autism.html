    <p>For parents, teachers and friends of an autistic struggling with this disorder is about as hard as it is to the children with autism. The following tips will help to ease everyday household life, both for parents and their children.

<p>Be Consistent</p>

<p>Children with autism take time to adapt skills learned in one environment, to other conditions, including the home environment. For example, your child can use sign language for communication in school, but will not think that he can also communicate at home. Creating a sequence in your child’s environment is the best way to consolidate your skills. Find out what therapists are working with the child at the moment, and do it at home. Study the possibility of conducting therapy in different places to stimulate your child to use the knowledge gained in a different environment.</p>

<p>Follow The Schedule</p>

<p>Children with autism tend to feel more comfortable if they have a well-structured schedule. Set a schedule indicating the exact time for eating, therapy, school and sleep. Try to keep changes in the schedule to a minimum. If the change is unavoidable, prepare the child in advance.</p>

<p>Encourage Good Behavior</p>

<p> Positive strengthening can significantly help you in progress, so make every effort to find something for which you can encourage the child. Praise children when they act appropriately or use a new skill, while clearly articulating what you praise the child for. In addition, look for other ways to encourage them for good behavior, for example, to give a sticker or allow them to play with your favorite toy.</p>

<p>Create A Home Security Zone</p>

<p>Give the child space in your home, where he can relax, feel protected and be safe. The boundaries should be set so that the child can understand them. You can use visual markers (colored tapes or the zones indicated by pictures / photos). You should be sure that the allocated area is really safe for your child, especially if he is prone to hysterics or self-aggression.

<p>Find The Nonverbal Mode Of Communication</p>

<p>Establishing communication with an autistic child can be a challenge, but you do not need to talk for communication. You already communicate with your child - the way you look at it, touch it, the tone of your voice and the language of your body - all this is also communication. And your child also communicates with you, even if he never expresses it in words. You just need to learn this language.</p>

<p>Find Out The Reason For His Hysterics</p>

<p> It is quite natural for any child to get upset because he is not understood or ignored. If you encounter such a situation, then most likely the reason is that you do not catch his non-verbal signals. Having arranged a tantrum, the child tries to attract your attention and express his disappointment.</p>

<p>Make Time For Fun</p>

<p>The child with ADS is still a child. Both the child and his parents need to enjoy life and try not to turn it solely into therapy. Schedule time for games for the period of maximum activity of the child. Find ways to have fun together, think about what makes a child smile, laugh and lets him “open up.” Your child will enjoy such moments, especially when he realizes that this is not related to therapy or training.</p>
