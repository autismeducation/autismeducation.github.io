    <p>Almost all of the kids with autism show agressive symptoms and have a hard time controlling their anger. To reduce agression in autistic to minimum, some important stp need to be taken. And he best one of them is starting a treatment of your child. </p>

<p>With such a variety of treatments for autism, understanding which method is right for your child can be quite a challenge. It also complicates the situation and the fact that you can hear different and sometimes even contradictory responses from parents and doctors. You need to take into account that there is no single method of treatment that will work for everyone, and this must be taken into account when drawing up a treatment plan for your child. Everyone with ADS is unique, with its strengths and weaknesses.

<p>Treatment Plan</p>

<p>A good treatment plan should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be based on your child’s interests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be a clear plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Include tasks consisting of a number of simple steps</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actively include your child in highly structured activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assuming regular reinforcement of behavior</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume the participation of parents</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Questions To Ask When Making A Treatment Plan</p>

<p>The treatment of child with autism must be adapted according to his individual needs. No one knows your child better than you, so you need to check that these needs are met. To make this easier, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are the strengths of your child?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the weaknesses of your child?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What behavior causes the most difficulties?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are your child’s important skills?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is it easier for your child to learn (using visual stimuli, auditory or physical)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What gives your child pleasure, and how can this be used in treatment?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, finally, always remember that no matter what treatment plan was chosen, your participation is crucial to success. You can help your child get the maximum effect from the treatment if you work closely with the team of therapists and continue to implement therapy at home.</p>

<p>The Choice Of A Method Of Treatment Of Autism</p>

<p>There are a huge number of different methods and approaches to treating autism. Some of them are aimed at eliminating problem behavior, building communication and social skills, while others are more focused on problems of sensory integration, motor skills, emotional problems and food sensitivity.</p>

<p>In connection with the existence of such a wide choice, it is extremely important to conduct your own research, talk with experts and find out all the questions that interest you. But keep in mind that you do not need to choose only one treatment method. Often, a combined treatment approach is required that can take advantage of the various therapies.</p>

<p>In general, autism treatment programs include behavioral therapy, speech therapy, game therapy, occupational therapy and nutritional therapy.</p>

<p>Find Help And Support</p>

<p>Taking care of a child with ADS can require you a lot of energy and time. There will be days when you can feel exhausted, desperate and tense. Raising children is not always easy, but raising a child with features is an even more difficult task. To be a better parent, it’s important to take care of yourself.</p>

<p>Autism Support Groups</p>

<p> A support group is an opportunity to meet other families with the same difficulties as you. Parents can share information, get advice and provide emotional support to each other. Even just being with others “in the same boat” and sharing experience, one can cope with the feeling of “isolation” that parents often experience when they receive a diagnosis of ADS from their child.</p>

<p>Temporary Care</p>

<p>Each parent needs time for rest. And for the parents of a special child, this is especially true. A temporary nanny can take care of the child for a short time, giving you a rest for several hours, days or even weeks.</p>

<p>Individual, Marital Or Family Counseling</p>

<p> If you experience stress, anxiety and depression, you can visit the doctor yourself. Therapy is a place where you can frankly talk about all of yours. Spousal or family counseling can also help resolve problems in the relationship of spouses and other family members.</p>
