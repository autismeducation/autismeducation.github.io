    <p>It is difficult for us not to scold them while educating children with autism. Sometimes we have to warn them to protect themselves from danger. Autistic children have problems with communication and social development. They can not understand the meaning of the words, the cause-effect relation in the whole. It is very difficult for them to change their behavior according to their senses. This is the case even in autistic children who communicate well at the moment. It is necessary to give good behavior to us in order to cultivate.</p>

<h1 id="achieving-good-behaviors-in-autism-for-educators">Achieving Good Behaviors in Autism for Educators</h1>
<p># 
In our world there are many words of “Do not do this”
“You do not understand me at all.” (X) “You said you never did it” (x)
We want to say it like it is in the tops. First of all, you have to think about what an autistic child can not understand. If an autistic child says “sorry,” or “I will not do that anymore,” then he would say that he is using these words to escape from this situation. I mean the words are just a means to hide themselves. Through language we live in a world surrounded by social ties. Children who have difficulty understanding congenital concepts can not be expected to do so. Autistic children understand voices by translating spoken language into visual language in their own minds. Autistic children can be extremely uncomfortable with high sesten. With a thought, you bring the feedback like “do not do it”, “wrong way”, “X” back to your eyes again, with a loud voice. You can only alert autistic children to a lethal accident or to a loud bell in case of a moral ban. Warnings in rare cases with a loud voice will be effective for their understandings.</p>

<h2 id="giving-concrete-examples">Giving Concrete examples</h2>
<p>## 
We should give concrete examples to autistic children and then we should celebrate them when they get something. Dada school is a 45 minute walk. On the way, the channel attracts attention and often goes down into the canal. We call him “get out of the canal” and say “do not go into the canal”. We congratulate him when Dada comes out of the channel. It is not good to have a hard reaction to an autistic child exhibiting a wrong behavior, such as going into a canal. If there is no danger, we can calmly follow him in the eye and at an appropriate time, we can say “get out of the channel.” It is difficult for children with autism to know whether they are walking on the right or left. We say to him, “Walk on the left,” walk on the right. “ If Dada goes to the right, we congratulate him; “You can walk on the right, we are proud of you”. Sometimes Dada pays or wears our clothes or our towels around her neck to prevent the mobility of the outside world. It comforts Dada. When you take Dada from time to time, we celebrate, “Dada, you can see it underneath. It makes you happy, is not it? “ Dada can take them out slowly.</p>

<h3 id="having-good-behavior-and-positive-reinforcement">Having Good Behavior and Positive Reinforcement</h3>
<p>### 
For example, in a mathematics class, an autistic child said, “I do not do math,” you said, and then you made a house of paper together. The paper house was so beautiful, and I’ve got it for her. “You made it, it was great”. This method is wrong, because you praise his escape behavior. It is very important for an autistic child to do his daily activities regularly. The time of the activity in the school has been determined. If you change the content of the timeline, the autistic child will not be able to identify activities of daily living.</p>

<p>How then should we do that?</p>

<p>1- Trying to change the room
2- Trying to reduce the amount of subjects
3- Trying to change the quality of the subject. as.</p>

<p>You have to tell autistic children not to run away.</p>
