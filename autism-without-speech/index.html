    <p>Autism, which can occur up to a certain age in children with autism, is usually identified with certain symptoms, such as speech impairment. In some autistic children, autism without speech can be performed until the age of 2 may develop more difficult and difficult than other peers. At this point in general, these children cannot build these sentences even though they can easily build a few words sentences due to the troubles in language development. Autistic children who acquire a new conversation habit often perform grammatical errors during their conversation and repeat these grammatical errors repeatedly.

<h1 id="autism-without-speech-and-speech-disturbance">Autism Without Speech and Speech Disturbance</h1>
<p># 
<a href="https://otsimo.com/en/help-nonverbal-child-speak/">Speech disorders in autism</a>, as determined by a number of symptoms, develop due to the difficulty of children in initiating a conversation. It is very difficult for autistic children to start a conversation when there is a great inadequacy in communicating with people in their surroundings. A conversation initiated in bilateral communication is a process that cannot be carried out by children with autism in a healthy manner. After a period of this conversation the child continues inward and out of communication. Generally speaking, children tend to develop their own language differently according to the communication and language skills used and tend to repeat the words they hear repeatedly against autism without speech.</p>

<h2 id="speech-disorder-and-echolalia-in-autism">Speech Disorder and Echolalia in Autism</h2>
<p>## 
<a href="https://autismeducation.me/autism-will-child-speak/">Echolalia syndrome</a> can be seen in autistic children due to autism without speech. This disturbance can also be seen when autistic children begin to repeat the voices they hear in people they communicate with, and in some cases repeat them with delay. For example, when a child is told to sit down, he or she responds directly or after a certain period of time, as an example of the appearance of the autism without speech. In autistic children, it is necessary to first investigate the reasons for elimination of this distress and then prefer not to respond to this reaction, which is shown by the child in the first stage, and to take another interest in this point. The award can also be given when attention is not taken in another direction.</p>
