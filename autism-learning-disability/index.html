    <p>In autism, where many families have to deal with, learning disabilities often arise with a number of genetically mediated factors. It is estimated that genetic factors are the main cause of autism with learning disability, although science has not yet clearly demonstrated this to be concrete. However, neurological causes also have a great share among the causes of autism with learning disability. Approximately 30% of autistic children have a number of abnormal electrical movements in their brains.

<h1 id="types-of-autism-with-learning-disability">Types of Autism with Learning Disability</h1>
<p># 
In autism, which can occur in many different forms, learning disability is a condition that needs to be well assessed. Especially autistic children, who have difficulty in social communication, bring various behavior problems in this issue. Autistic children are struggling when the relationships between individuals are very difficult to establish. It is also not easy for autistic children to be able to maintain an established relationship. Yet eye contact, which has an important place in social relations, is a lack in almost all children having autism with learning disability. Autistic children who can not express many emotions such as love, anger and pity can face the problem of being excluded by their friends in their surroundings. In addition, autistic children, who have difficulty in initiating interaction, also have to make serious efforts to maintain the established interaction.</p>

<h2 id="repeated-behaviors-caused-by-autism-with-learning-disability">Repeated Behaviors caused by Autism with Learning Disability</h2>
<p>## 
One of the most confrontational behaviors in the name of autism with learning disability is the constant repetition of the same movement. These motor movements are unconsciously repetitive and sometimes repeated for a few minutes. Also, children with autism need to be adaptable to change. Children who are highly committed to the routines of everyday life constantly insist on sameness. Autistic children, whose interests are very narrow, are not aware of their surroundings because they give the whole concentration in this area close to one hundred percent. There is an imbalance in the emotional sense, because sometimes it happens to be a little and sometimes a lot of arousal.</p>
