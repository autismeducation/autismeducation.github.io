The best way to understand if an individual is autistic is by examining their behavior. Some behavioral disorders in autistic individuals make it easier to diagnose for autism. How autism starts, questions are questions that can be understood during early childhood.</p>

<p>Some common symptoms are present in most of the autistic individuals. For example, if the parents are not able to point to objects with their finger or if they are 6 months old, if the parents are having difficulty in identifying, if they are not addressed with their name, if they are 2 years old, parents are advised to go to a doctor if they can not play appropriate games. .</p>

Although not all children with behavioral disorders are autism-related, it is possible to recognize the diagnosis early and achieve high success with early diagnosis.
