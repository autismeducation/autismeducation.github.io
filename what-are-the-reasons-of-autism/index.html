<p>What Causes Autism?</p>

<p>The reasons of autism hasn’t been precisely discovered yet. There isn’t only one reason of autism. Nowadays it is know that autism has many reasons. The brain cells of autistic individuals work differently. Between brain cells the chemical transmitters have deficiency or surplus and some of the genetic illnesses are among the causes of autism .</p>

<p>Genetic Factors Play İmportant Role</p>

<p>Genetic factors plays an important role in the causes of autism. The studies on twins and relatives verify this important role. But studies shows that genetic is not the only reason of autism. If genetic is the only reason of autism both of all identical twins had autism when one of the twins has autism. But the state isn’t always like this.</p>

<p>Also Environmental Factors Are Effective</p>

<p>Also the studies show that environmental factors have a role in autism. Between prenatal and post-natal factors and autism, dramatical relations have been detected. Studies show that individuals have genetically tendency to autism have the risk of having problem at the period of birth highly. Additionaly it is known that at the period of pregnancy having rubella problem is effective on autism.</p>

<p>The Arise Of Autism With Rates</p>

<p>Nowadays it is absolutely known that the reason of autism isn’t because of only one factor. Autism is a disorder affected by more than one factor which is a reasonably complex problem.</p>

<p>Researchers agree that males are four times more likely to be autistic than females. Seventy percent of autistic individuals have mental retardation. Thirty percent of them are normal and ten percent of this rate has superior intelligence. Epilepsy, attention deficit disorders with hyperactivity or mood disorders are seen with autism commonly. One of three autistics have the epileptic risks.
